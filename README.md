## Image classification using CNN techniques and integrating with fastAPI

* For learning purpose *
Created multiple api's to understand how FastAPI works

## Image Classification

1. Used kaggle dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification
2. Used keras to perform image classificiation using Alexnet and VGG16 architecture.
3. Create an api with the upload feature to upload the image and get the prediction in response.
